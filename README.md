ToX
===
ToXicity is a lightweight game engine that runs in conjunction with LWJGL 3.
It is designed to be:
1. lightweight (less than 150kb!)
2. modular (minimal package interaction)
3. multithreaded
4. easy to use

Author's Note
-------------
I initially started this project in February of 2013.  After nearly two years of working on it, I feel like it is ready to be released.  By no means am I an expert on game engines or game design.  It is bound to be full of errors and discrepancies. Adding onto this, I'm aware that a lot of things haven't been done in the best or most efficient way.

If you would like to work on this project, then please inbox me.  There is a lot of code that could be improved, and I would love if more people could help.  Thank you for taking the time to check ToXicity out!

Using ToXicity
--------------
ToXicity is quite easy to set up.  You can find all of the needed files
1. Download the LWJGL JAR and natives
2. Download the ToXicity JAR
3. Add the LWJGL and ToXicity JAR as libraries in your project
4. Link the natives folder to the LWJGL JAR
5. Optionally link the source and JavaDoc for both JARs

Tutorials are provided on how to actually use ToXicity.
